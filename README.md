# SpeedGame
An MSX BASIC game I as a kid developed in 1985 or 1986. This is the first game I ever made.

In a class in my elementary school, I wrote this program while a computer programming class held on. As we had no disk or tape drive, I showed this source code to pals and they copied it to their notebooks with their pencils, and all of us enjoyed it, resulting in wreckage of space keys. The teacher banned that program, but she gave me good words.

Note: This is almost the original program I wrote back then. I tried to make it as same as I could.

# How to use

Grab a pencil. Write the source code down to your notebook.
Open WebMSX[https://webmsx.org/] and write the source code line by line.
Write `RUN` and hit enter key to start.
After the game is finished, do `RUN` again. Enjoy!
